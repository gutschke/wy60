On a recent version of Linux or a compatible system, the code can be
compiled by invoking "make all". It can be installed by running "make install"
as root, or you can manually copy the files:

  install -v -D -o root -g root -m 0755 -s wy60     /usr/local/bin/wy60
  install -v -D -o root -g root -m 0644    wy60.man /usr/local/man/man1/wy60.1
  install -v -D -o root -g root -m 0644    wy60.rc  /etc/wy60.rc

The source code assumes a couple of GCC and GNU specific extensions both
to the C compiler and the standard C library. If you try to compile the
software on a system other than Linux, this could conceivably cause you
some problems. In that case, you should try to install GCC on your
target system and point the Makefile to it. If that isn't sufficient, you
might have to make a couple of small changes to the source.

Please report back by sending e-mail to <wy60@lists.gutschke.com> if
you succeeded in compiling the source on a non-Linux system.

If you want to print the documentation, consider "make docs" for converting the
manual page to PostScript(tm).
