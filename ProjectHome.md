# Wyse 60 compatible terminal emulator #

While there are plenty of different terminal emulator programs available, the majority of them only provide support for VT100 or ANSI style escape codes. This is not a problem if your applications understand about the $TERM environment variable, but there are many legacy applications which have been hardcoded with support for the Wyse 60 family of terminals. This is where the Wy60 Emulator comes into play; it looks at the value of your $TERM environment variable and using the curses library, dynamically converts from Wyse 60 escape codes to whatever escape sequences your terminal requires. This allows you to continue using your favorite terminal program while running your old legacy programs.
The code has successfully been tested under Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, and Mac OS X -- and will probably run fine under any modern UNIX or POSIX compliant operating system. While this program is primarily written for UNIX style environments, it is possible to compile it against the Cygwin libraries and run it under Windows.

The quality of the emulation is getting better with every release, but there is still only a subset of escape commands that is currently supported. If you need 100% correct support for all commands, I suggest you get hold of a hardware Wyse 60 terminal (or file a detailed bug report against this project).
