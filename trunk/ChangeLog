	* Fixed configuration file parsing when embedding C-style escape
	sequences.

2003-02-15  Markus Gutschke <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* Work-around for terminal emulators that expect
	clear-to-end-of-screen to be issued from column 0. This quirk
	was noticed with the default terminal emulator in RedHat 8.0,
	but might exist in other programs as well.

2002-11-13  Markus Gutschke <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* The emulator detects the application trying to decrease the
	screen resolution, but the underlying host terminal failing to
	honor the request. In this case, we now use the newly requested
	screen dimensions rather than the physical ones for the
	computation of cursor positions. This only works if the physical
	screen of the host terminal is larger than the one requested by
	the application. The upshot is that the emulator now deals more
	gracefully with host terminals that do not know how to resize
	(e.g. current versions of the GNOME and KDE terminal emulators).

	* Work-around for applications that output undefined graphics
	characters.

2002-07-14  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* Allow users to override the identification string in the
	configuration file.

	* Added command line option to override configuration variables.
	
	* Emulate setupterm(), reset_shell_mode(), and tparm() if 
	<term.h> could not be found. As long as <curses.h> defines
	tgetent(), tgetflag(), tgetstr(), and tputs() we can emulate the
	rest.

	* With these changes, the emulator now runs on Mac OS X.

2002-07-13  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* Emulate poll() by calls to select() if the <sys/poll.h> include
	file does not exist.
	
2002-07-11  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* Both AIX and MacOS X seem to have difficulties with variadic
	arguments. Fall back to using fixed argument lists instead.

2002-06-04  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* Rather than closing stdin and stderr when calling external
	programs, redirect them to "/dev/null" instead.

	* Update the documentation with a new version of the "resize"
	shell script. This script knows how to find the current terminal
	from the value of stdout and no longer relies on stdin to point
	anywhere useful.

	* Added support for slave printing.

2002-06-04  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* The SIGCHLD signal handler should not use siglongjmp() as the
	signal isn't blocked (this code is mostly a result of trying to
	accomodate various UNIX systems that treat SIGCHLD specially).

	* Close stdin and stderr for the duration of running external
	resize scripts. We still must keep stdout open, though.

2002-06-02  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* Added optional support for job control. If the calling process
	enabled job control, then wy60 can pass this capability through to
	its children.

	* The code is now sufficiently feature rich to warrant upgrading
	the version number to 2.0.

2002-05-31  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* wy60 now attempts to correctly implement protected mode. Since I
	don't have a hardware Wyse 60 terminal, and I don't have full
	specs, I am not sure if I got all the corner cases right.

	* Do not reset the terminal at startup, initializing it is
	sufficient and seems to be less disruptive for most terminfo
	entries.

	* The attributes for protected mode weren't always initialized
	correctly.

2002-05-26  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* A lot more compatibility tweaks. The code is now more friendly
	to systems that have restrictive C compilers (i.e. pre C99),
	run-time libraries limited in functionality, or require System V
	streams.

	* User input uses buffered I/O now. This improves performance over
	high-latency network connections.

2002-05-21  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* Assorted performance improvements in dealing with the internal
	screen buffers.

	* Fixed a couple of minor redraw problems introduced with the
	screen buffers.

	* Do not clear old contents in buffers if the screen size has
	shrunk, unless there has also been a scrolling operation.

	* When requesting a change in screen size, wait for the terminal
	to adjust before continuing (or time out after about 1s).

2002-05-19  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* Major change in the way how characters are output. Wy60 now
	maintains internal buffers that mirror what is shown on the
	screen. This is the neccessary framework to add full support for
	protected mode. Protected mode itself has not been implemented,
	yet.

2002-05-15  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* Ported to Cygwin.

2002-05-13  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* Added ugly fall-back code that gets used if the C compiler does
	not understand GCC extensions.

	* Exit with error code 125 if the child process closed all its
	filehandles, but didn't terminate.

2002-05-12  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* Extended resizing code to understand about changes in both width
	and height of the console (i.e. supported modes are now 80x24,
	80x25, 80x42, 80x43, 132x24, 132x25, 132x42, 132x43).

	* Added a configuration option to specify an external program for
	screen resizing. This allows users to use SVGATextMode when
	running from the Linux text console.

	* Added a configuration option to override the attributes that
	indicate write-protect mode.

2002-05-11  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* Added support for automake/autoconf.

	* Verified that wy60 compiles and runs on both Linux and FreeBSD.

2002-01-07  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* Modified the terminal initialization code, so that BSD systems
	can properly set the controlling terminal.

2001-12-26  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* Added explicit buffering for all output to the
	console. Performance is back to where it was before getting rid of
	stdio calls.

2001-12-19  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* First attempt at making the code compile on FreeBSD. There are
	still a few caveats. wy60 must be run setuid root in order for the
	permissions on the pty to be updated. The Makefile must be
	manually configured for FreeBSD. There still seem to be some bugs
	in the handling of terminal settings (e.g. the session breaks
	after leaving emacs).

	* Had to get rid of most of the calls to the stdio library. This
	means performance is now somewhat degraded, because there is no
	buffering on I/O.

2001-11-17  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* Allow wy60 to become a user's default shell. This can be used if
	a specific user always should run all programs within the
	emulator.

	* Updated the manual page.

	* Released version 1.0.1

2001-11-16  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* Added full command line parsing. Unknown parameters are still
	forwarded to the child process.

	* Introduced a distinction between launching a regular child
	process or an inferior shell. Only shells understand about leading
	'-' characters signaling a login shell.

	* Updated the documentation.

	* Released version 1.0

2001-11-11  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* Added support for dynamically changing the window size if
	supported by the host terminal emulation. This works for recent
	versions of xterm.

	* Added lots of predefined function key definitions. This works
	around the lack of proper terminfo entries for many host terminal
	emulators.

	* Completed code for parsing the configuration file.

	* Move cursors to closest corner if attempt is made to move it off
	the screen.

	* Check for all mandatory capabilities before emulation starts.

	* Added some more alternative algorithms to use if some of the
	capabilities are missing from the host terminal. Also, added code
	to prefer using parameterized commands if available.

	* Made sure that we only attempt to scroll if in top or bottom
	corner (this is suggested by the terminfo manual page).

	* Successfully tested wy60 running within a 3270 emulator.

2001-11-10  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* Update internal cursor position when the screen gets cleared.

	* Added several conditional debugging modes for tracing program
	execution. This code is not usually compiled in.

	* Fixed attribute handling and switched to using colors if
	available.

	* Added support for graphics characters.

	* Output all of the terminal's reset or initialization strings
	both at program startup and termination.

2001-11-02  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* wy60 jumps to last character in previous line if backspace is
	issued in the first column. This fixes a display glitch in "vi".
	
	* Removed signal handling for SIGSTOP et. al, as these currently
	seem to be impossible to raise anyway.

	* Added code that parses escape sequences in the user input and
	maps function keys to the corresponding wy60 escape sequences.

	* Started work on parsing configuration files.

	* Added a "make install" target.
	
2001-10-29  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* Improved handling of terminal size changes.

2001-10-28  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* Initial public release.

	* All of the core features are implemented. It is possible to run
	programs such emacs, vi, or less in the emulator. The emulator can
	also successfully emulate itself.

	* A lot of advanced features are still missing. Most notably this
	includes the status bar, programmable function keys, and text
	segments. It is not clear which of these features are actually
	used by real-life applications.
