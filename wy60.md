## NAME ##

wy60 - curses based emulator for the Wyse 60 terminal

## SYNOPSIS ##

**wy60** `[` **-c** | **--command** _command_ `]` `[` **-h** | **--help** `]` `[` **-j** | **--job-control** { **on** | **off** } `]` `[` **-l** | **--login** `]` `[` **-o** | **--option** _key_**=**_value_ `]` `[` **-t** | **--term** _terminal_ `]` `[` **-v** | **--version** `]` `[` **--** `]` _shell arguments_

## DESCRIPTION ##

The **wy60** utility program invokes a new shell or _command_ and adjusts the **$TERM** environment variable to have a value of _wyse60_. All commands executed within this shell or any of its child processes automatically have their terminal escape sequences translated to be processed by the terminal that **wy60** was invoked from.

Unless a different _command_ was requested, the user's default shell as determined by the value of the **$SHELL** environment variable is invoked. If the environment variable has not been set, then the default system shell _/bin/sh_ is used instead. This value can be overridden in the configuration file.

## OPTIONS ##

Parameters are parsed until the first unknown parameter is encountered, or until the special parameter **--** is found. All the following parameters are passed on to the inferior shell or to the user specified _command_. Check the manual page for **sh**(1) for a detailed list of options.

The following parameters are directly understood by **wy60** and will not be forwarded to any child process unless they appear after the **--** marker or after another set of unknown parameters:

  * **-c** | **--command** _command_

> Rather than invoking the user's shell, run the specified _command_, instead.

  * **-h** | **--help**

> Display a brief usage message showing the valid command line parameters.

  * **-j** | **--job-control** { **on** | **off** }

> Enable or disable job control. If the parent process is a shell that supports job control then **wy60** can enable this capability for its children by forking an additional process monitoring the children. By default, this option is enabled.

  * **-l** | **--login**

> Invoke the inferior shell as a login shell. This is done by prepending a minus character to the application name. This convention is supported by all shells but probably gets ignored by most other applications. The **--login** parameter is ignored if the **--command** parameter has also been given.

> As a special case, it is possible to make **wy60** a user's default login shell. To do so, **wy60** must be entered into the **shells**(5) file and you must call **chsh**(1) to change the user's default shell. If the emulator detects that it is invoked as a wrapper for a shell, it ignores all command line parameters. It then resets **$SHELL** to the value specified in the configuration file or to _/bin/sh_ and launches that shell passing all the parameters that were given to **wy60**.

  * **-o** | **--option** _key_**=**_value_

> All of the configuration variables listed later in this document can also be overriden on the command line. The syntax is identical to the one used in the configuration files.

> When using this option, it might be neccessary to quote the key/value pair to prevent the shell from expanding escape sequences.

  * **-t** | **--term** _terminal_

> Override the value of the **$TERM** environment variable. If this parameter is not present, then a default of _wyse60_ will be used for the value that is passed to the inferior shell.

  * **-v** | **--version**

> Display the version number of the program and the date when it was compiled.

  * **--**

> All parameters following this argument will be literally passed to the inferior shell.

## EXAMPLES ##

  * **wy60**

> If invoked without parameters, an interactive shell is invoked.

  * **wy60 -c emacs -nw README**

> The **-c** parameter can be used to directly invoke an interactive application that should run in an emulated environment. The emulator will terminate when the invoked application has quit.

  * **wy60 -c infocmp**

> Use **infocmp**(1M) to verify that the **terminfo**(5) database has appropriate entries for the emulated _wyse60_ terminal.

  * **TERM=xterm-mono wy60**

> By default, **wy60** uses colors instead of text attributes if available. If you prefer
> seeing traditional text attributes instead, start **wy60** in a terminal that does not
> support ANSI colors.

## CONFIGURATION FILES ##

Some of the execution parameters can be controlled through configuration files. Every user can have a private configuration file in _$HOME/.wy60rc_ that overrides any system-wide settings. The system administrator can also set global parameters in _/usr/local/etc/wy60.rc_ or in _/etc/wy60.rc_.

All configuration files are in plain ASCII format. Comments are introduced by the hash mark **#** character and extend to the end of the line. Blank lines are ignored. All lines are of the form **variable = value**.

Variable names are case insensitive. Leading and trailing white space for both the variables and the values is stripped prior to processing. Non ASCII characters have to be escaped:

  * **\**_ooo_

> Up to three octal digits can be used to specify a character in the range **\001** through **\177**.

  * **\x**_XX_

> Up to two hexadecimal digits can be used to specify a character in the range **\x01** through **\xFF**.

  * **\a**

> The **BEL** character (ASCII 7).

  * **\b**

> The **BS** character (ASCII 8).

  * **\e**

> The **ESC** character (ASCII 27).

  * **\f**

> The **FF** character (ASCII 12).

  * **\n**

> The **NL** character (ASCII 10).

  * **\r**

> The **CR** character (ASCII 13).

  * **\t**

> The **TAB** character (ASCII 9).

  * **\v**

> The **VT** character (ASCII 11).

Please note that continuation lines are not supported and that is not possible to input a **NUL** character (ASCII 0).

The configuration file supports the following parameters:

  * **IDENTIFIER**

> The terminal identifier string that is reported when an _ENQ_ (ASCII 5) is received, can be overridden by setting the **IDENTIFIER** configuration variable. If this option is not set, then the emulator replies with an _ACK_ (ASCII 6).

  * **PRINTCOMMAND**

> Programs can print to a local printer by sending escape codes to **wy60**. If this variable is set to "_auto_" then **wy60** will try to print to either **lp**(1) or to **lpr**(1). Otherwise, this variable should contain the name of a script that can accept data on its standard input.

  * **RESIZE**

> If you want to use an external script to resize the console, then you can specify the absolute path to this script by setting the **RESIZE** configuration variable. For example, if you have **SVGATextMode**(8) installed and you want to run **wy60** from the Linux text console, then you might try using a script such as this one:
```
   #!/bin/sh
   PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin

   egrep '.+' /proc/fb >&2 && exit 0
   (tty <&3 | egrep '^/dev/tty[0-9]*$' >&2) 3<&1
   if test "$?" -eq 0; then
     SVGATextMode "$1x$2"   <&1 >&2 ||
     SVGATextMode "$1x$2x9" <&1 >&2 ||
     SVGATextMode "$1x$2x8" <&1 >&2
   fi
   exit 0
```

> Make sure that **SVGATextMode**(8) understands these modes: 80x24, 80x25, 80x42, 80x43, 132x24, 132x25, 132x42, 132x43.

  * **SHELL**

> If neither a _command_ has been passed on the command line, nor the user's **$SHELL** environment variable was set, then use this variable to determine the default shell. If the variable is not set, then a value of _/bin/sh_ is used instead.

  * **TERM**

> If no _terminal_ type has been specified on the command line, the program defaults to _wyse60_. This default value can by overridden by setting the **TERM** configuration variable.

  * **WRITEPROTECT**

> The default attribute for indicating write-protect mode is _REVERSE_. This value can be overridden by setting the **WRITEPROTECT** configuration variable to one of these values: _NORMAL_, _BLANK_, _BLINK_, _REVERSE_, _UNDERSCORE_, _DIM_. The attributes can be combined with each other by listing multiple in the same line.

All the other variables specify character sequences that should be sent whenever the user presses a function key. The following table lists the variable name, the default value, and the **terminfo**(5) name for the function key.

Not all of these keys are necessarily available on all types of terminals. This is particularly true for the keys with the **Alt** modifier, which assume that the terminal precedes all characters with an **ESC** character if **Alt** is pressed.

## EXIT STATUS ##

  * **0**

> Successful program execution.

  * **125**

> The inferior shell or _command_ terminated abnormally.

  * **126**

> The emulator has been terminated by an unexpected signal.

  * **127**

> Some fatal error prevented or aborted the execution of **wy60**.

  * _Other_

> The inferior shell or _command_ returned a non-zero exit status.

## DIAGNOSTICS ##

The most common cause for the emulator to fail is the **$TERM** environment variable not being set or the terminal having insufficient capabilities. If this happens, try using a more powerful terminal type and also use **infocmp**(1M) to verify that your **terminfo**(5) database is configured correctly.

You might also see an error message saying that the terminal size could not be determined. **wy60** requires that the terminal settings have been configured properly prior to invoking the emulator. This usually happens at the time when you log into the system, but you can also adjust the values by calling **stty**(1).

If the emulator complains that it cannot launch the child process then verify that **$SHELL** is set and points to a valid shell.

## FILES ##

  * _$HOME/.wy60rc_

> Per-user configuration settings.

  * _/usr/local/etc/wy60.rc_

> System-wide configuration settings.

  * _/etc/wy60.rc_

> System-wide configuration settings (this file must be created manually and does not get overwritten when upgrading **wy60**).

  * _/usr/share/terminfo/?/`*`_

> Files containing terminal descriptions.

## ENVIRONMENT ##

The **$TERM** environment variable must be set for the emulator to work. If the **$SHELL** environment variable is set, its value will be used for launching the inferior shell. Otherwise a default filename is taken from the configuration files or _/bin/sh_ is used. The emulator sets the **$TERM**, **$COLUMNS**, and **$LINES** environment variables for its child processes.

## SEE ALSO ##

**chsh**(1), **infocmp**(1M), **lp**(1), **lpr**(1), **sh**(1), **shells**(5), **stty**(1), **SVGATextMode**(8), **terminfo**(5), **tput**(1), **xterm**(1).

## SECURITY ##

The program can be executed with normal user privileges. As such, the amount of damage that a malicious application could cause is limited to the user's account. To the best of the author's knowledge the current version of **wy60** does not have any security issues, but common sense should still be used whenever running any untrusted software within the emulator.

## BUGS ##

The emulator attempts to seamlessly switch to _wyse60_ emulation. This requires the ability to query the host terminal for its cursor position at the time when the emulator is started. As **terminfo**(5) does not provide this capability, **wy60** can only support seamless switching on a small number of well known terminal types. If it does not recognize the terminal type, then the screen will be cleared at startup.

The escape sequences for setting the screen size can only be processed if the host terminal supports dynamic resizing under program control. Currently, **xterm**(1) appears to be the only program that has this capability.

Function keys work only if the host terminal generates distinct character sequences for each of them and if the **terminfo**(5) entry for the host terminal is correct. Frequently one or the other is not the case which limits the usability of the emulator. Testing has shown, that the most correct implementation appears to be available in very recent versions of **xterm**(1).

The current version of the emulator supports only a small subset of the full features offered by a real _Wyse 60_ terminal. Several of the advanced features are missing. Most notably this means that there is no support for reprogrammable function keys (but you can use the configuration file to assign strings to individual keys) or for the status bar. Frequently, the supported set of escape sequences is sufficient to run an application within the emulated environment, but if that does not work, you should consider either filing a detailed bug report with the author or you should switch to using a hardware terminal.
