While all modern POSIX based applications that require control of a
text terminal use either termcap or terminfo to determine escape
sequences, there are still old legacy applications that use hard coded
values. Often, the source code for these applications is not available
or for some other reason it proves impracticle to modify the existing
application. If the hard coded values correspond to a commonly used
terminal type (such as the VT100(tm) series and its derivatives) then the
user is in luck and there is a wide variety of useable terminal
emulators. If, on the other hand, the program assumes a less common
terminal type such as the Wyse 60(tm) hardware terminal, then choices
are limited.

This is were "wy60" comes it. It can be invoked from within any one of
many commonly used terminal emulators as long as there is a working
terminfo entry for it. It sets up a emulation environment converting
between Wyse 60(tm) escape sequences and the escape codes of the host
system, and launches a shell to run within this emulated environment.

The current set of supported escape sequences is limited, but should
suffice to run many existing legacy applications without requiring any
changes.
