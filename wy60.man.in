.SH NAME
wy60 \- curses based emulator for the Wyse 60\*(Tm terminal
.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP
.B wy60
[\ \fB-c\fP\ |\ \fB--command\fP\ \fIcommand\fP\ ] [\ \fB-h\fP\ |\ \fB--help\fP\ ] [\ \fB-l\fP\ |\ \fB--login\fP\ ] [\ \fB-t\fP\ |\ \fB--term\fP\ \fIterminal\fP\ ] [\ \fB-v\fP\ |\ \fB--version\fP\ ] [\ \fB--\fP\ ] \fIshell\ arguments\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B wy60
utility program invokes a new shell or
.I command
and adjusts the
.B $TERM
environment variable to have a value of
.IR wyse60 .
All commands executed within this shell or any of its child processes
automatically have their terminal escape sequences translated to be
processed by the terminal that
.B wy60
was invoked from.
.P
Unless a different
.I command
was requested, the user's default shell as determined by the value of the
.B $SHELL
environment variable is invoked. If the environment variable has not been set,
then the default system shell
.I /bin/sh
is used instead. This value can be overridden in the configuration file.
.SH OPTIONS
Parameters are parsed until the first unknown parameter is encountered, or
until the special parameter
.B --
is found. All the following parameters are passed on to the inferior shell or
to the user specified
.IR command .
Check the manual page for
.BR sh (1)
for a detailed list of options.
.P
The following parameters are directly understood by
.B wy60
and will not be forwarded to any child process unless they appear after
the
.B --
marker or after another set of unknown parameters:
.TP \w'\-c\ |\ 'u
\fB-c\fP\ |\ \fB--command\fP\ \fIcommand\fP
Rather than invoking the user's shell, run the specified
.IR command ,
instead.
.TP
\fB-h\fP\ |\ \fB--help\fP
Display a brief usage message showing the valid command line parameters.
.TP
\fB-l\fP\ |\ \fB--login\fP
Invoke the inferior shell as a login shell. This is done by prepending a
minus character to the application name. This convention is supported by
all shells but probably gets ignored by most other applications. The
.B --login
parameter is ignored if the
.B --command
parameter has also been given.

As a special case, it is possible to make
.B wy60
a user's default login shell. To do so,
.B wy60
must be entered into the
.BR shells (5)
file and you must call
.BR chsh (1)
to change the user's default shell. If the emulator detects that it is invoked
as a wrapper for a shell, it ignores all command line parameters. It then
resets
.B $SHELL
to the value specified in the configuration file or to
.I /bin/sh
and launches that shell passing all the parameters that were given to
.BR wy60 .
.TP
\fB-t\fP\ |\ \fB--term\fP\ \fIterminal\fP
Override the value of the
.B $TERM
environment variable. If this parameter is not present, then a default of
.I wyse60
will be used for the value that is passed to the inferior shell.
.TP
\fB-v\fP\ |\ \fB--version\fP
Display the version number of the program and the date when it was compiled.
.TP
\fB--\fP
All parameters following this argument will be literally passed to the
inferior shell.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP \w'wy60\ 'u
.B wy60
If invoked without parameters, an interactive shell is invoked.
.TP
.B wy60 \-c emacs \-nw README
The
.B \-c
parameter can be used to directly invoke an interactive application that should
run in an emulated environment. The emulator will terminate when the invoked
application has quit.
.TP
.B wy60 \-c infocmp
use
.BR infocmp (1M)
to verify that the
.BR terminfo (5)
database has appropriate entries for the emulated
.I wyse60
terminal.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILES
Some of the execution parameters can be controlled through configuration
files. Every user can have a private configuration file in
.I $HOME/.wy60rc
that overrides any system-wide settings. The system administrator can also
set global parameters in
.IR @SYSCONFDIR@/wy60.rc
or in
.IR /etc/wy60.rc .
.P
All configuration files are in plain ASCII format. Comments are introduced by
the hash mark
.B #
character and extend to the end of the line. Blank lines are ignored. All
lines are of the form
.BR "variable = value" .
Variable names are case insensitive. Leading and trailing white space for both
the variables and the values is stripped prior to processing. Non ASCII
characters have to be escaped:
.TP 6
.BI \e ooo
Up to three octal digits can be used to specify a character in the range
.B \e001
through
.BR \e177 .
.TP
.BI \ex XX
Up to two hexadecimal digits can be used to specify a character in the range
.B \ex01
through
.BR \exFF .
.TP
.B \ea
The
.B BEL
character (ASCII 7).
.TP
.B \eb
The
.B BS
character (ASCII 8).
.TP
.B \ee
The
.B ESC
character (ASCII 27).
.TP
.B \ef
The
.B FF
character (ASCII 12).
.TP
.B \en
The
.B NL
character (ASCII 10).
.TP
.B \er
The
.B CR
character (ASCII 13).
.TP
.B \et
The
.B TAB
character (ASCII 9).
.TP
.B \ev
The
.B VT
character (ASCII 11).
.P
Please note that continuation lines are not supported and that is not
possible to input a
.B NUL
character (ASCII 0).
.P
The configuration file supports the following parameters:
.TP \w'RESIZE\ \ \ \ 'u
.B TERM
If no
.I terminal
type has been specified on the command line, the program defaults to
.IR wyse60 .
This default value can by overridden by setting the
.B TERM
configuration variable.
.TP
.B SHELL
If neither a
.I command
has been passed on the command line, nor the user's
.B $SHELL
environment variable was set, then use this variable to determine the
default shell. If the variable is not set, then a value of
.I /bin/sh
is used instead.
.TP
.B RESIZE
If you want to use an external script to resize the console, then you can
specify the absolute path to this script by setting the
.B RESIZE
configuration variable. For example, if you have
.BR SVGATextMode (8)
installed and you want to run
.B wy60
from the Linux text console, then you might try using a script such as
this one:
.ft CW
.TS
;
l.
#!/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin
egrep '.+' /proc/fb >/dev/null 2>&1 && exit 0
tty | egrep '^/dev/tty[0-9]*$' >/dev/null 2>&1 || exit 0
SVGATextMode "$1x$2"   >/dev/null 2>&1 ||
SVGATextMode "$1x$2x9" >/dev/null 2>&1 ||
SVGATextMode "$1x$2x8" >/dev/null 2>&1
exit 0
.TE
.ft R
Make sure that
.BR SVGATextMode (8)
understands these modes: 80x24, 80x25, 80x42, 80x43, 132x24, 132x25, 132x42,
132x43.
.TP
.B WRITEPROTECT
The default attribute for indicating write-protect mode is
.IR REVERSE .
This value can be overridden by setting the
.B WRITEPROTECT
configuration variable to one of these values:
.IR NORMAL ,\  BLANK ,\  BLINK ,\  REVERSE ,\  UNDERSCORE ,\  DIM .
The attributes can be combined with each other by listing multiple in the
same line.
.P
All the other variables specify character sequences that should be sent
whenever the user presses a function key. The following table lists the
variable name, the default value, and the
.BR terminfo (5)
name for the function key.

.TE
.P
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
Successful program execution.
.TP
.B 125
The inferior shell or
.I command
terminated abnormally.
.TP
.B 126
The emulator has been terminated by an unexpected signal.
.TP
.B 127
Some fatal error prevented or aborted the execution of
.BR wy60 .
.TP
.I Other
The inferior shell or
.I command
returned a non-zero exit status.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The most common cause for the emulator to fail is the
.B $TERM
environment variable not being set or the terminal having insufficient
capabilities. If this happens, try using a more powerful terminal type and
also use
.BR infocmp (1M)
to verify that your
.BR terminfo (5)
database is configured correctly.
.P
You might also see an error message saying that the terminal size could
not be determined.
.B wy60
requires that the terminal settings have been configured properly prior to
invoking the emulator. This usually happens at the time when you log into
the system, but you can also adjust the values by calling
.BR stty (1).
.P
If the emulator complains that it cannot launch the child process then
verify that
.B $SHELL
is set and points to a valid shell.
.SH FILES
.TP 24
.I $HOME/.wy60rc
Per-user configuration settings.
.TP
.I @SYSCONFDIR@/wy60.rc
System-wide configuration settings.
.TP
.I /etc/wy60.rc
System-wide configuration settings (this file must be created manually and
does not get overwritten when upgrading
.BR wy60 ).
.TP
.I /usr/share/terminfo/?/*
Files containing terminal descriptions.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The
.B $TERM
environment variable must be set for the emulator to work. If the
.B $SHELL
environment variable is set, its value will be used for launching the
inferior shell. Otherwise a default filename is taken from the configuration
files or
.I /bin/sh
is used.
.P
The emulator sets the
.BR $TERM ", " $COLUMNS ", and " $LINES
environment variables for its child processes.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR chsh (1),
.BR infocmp (1M),
.BR sh (1),
.BR shells (5),
.BR stty (1),
.BR SVGATextMode (8),
.BR terminfo (5),
.BR tput (1),
.BR xterm (1).
.SH SECURITY
The program can be executed with normal user privileges. As such, the amount
of damage that a malicious application could cause is limited to the user's
account. To the best of the author's knowledge the current version of
.B wy60
does not
have any security issues, but common sense should still be used whenever
running any untrusted software within the emulator.

.SH BUGS
The emulator attempts to seamlessly switch to
.I wyse60
emulation. This requires the ability to query the host terminal for its
cursor position at the time when the emulator is started. As
.BR terminfo (5)
does not provide this capability,
.B wy60
can only support seamless switching on a small number of well known terminal
types. If it does not recognize the terminal type, then the screen will be
cleared at startup.
.P
The escape sequences for setting the screen size can only be processed if
the host terminal supports dynamic resizing under program control. Currently,
.BR xterm (1)
appears to be the only program that has this capability.
.P
Function keys work only if the host terminal generates distinct character
sequences for each of them and if the
.BR terminfo (5)
entry for the host terminal is correct. Frequently one or the other is not
the case which limits the usability of the emulator. Testing has shown, that
the most correct implementation appears to be available in very recent
versions of
.BR xterm (1).
.P
The current version of the emulator supports only a small subset of the
full features offered by a real
.I Wyse 60\*(Tm
terminal. Several of the advanced features are missing. Most notably this
means that there is no support for reprogrammable function keys (but you can
use the configuration file to assign strings to individual keys) or for the
status bar. Frequently, the supported set of escape sequences is sufficient to
run an application within the emulated environment, but if that does not work,
you should consider either filing a detailed bug report with the author or
you should switch to using a hardware terminal.
