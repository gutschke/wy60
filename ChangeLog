	* Added explicit buffering for all output to the
	console. Performance is back to where it was before getting rid of
	stdio calls.

2001-12-19  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* First attempt at making the code compile on FreeBSD. There are
	still a few caveats. wy60 must be run setuid root in order for the
	permissions on the pty to be updated. The Makefile must be
	manually configured for FreeBSD. There still seem to be some bugs
	in the handling of terminal settings (e.g. the session breaks
	after leaving emacs).

	* Had to get rid of most of the calls to the stdio library. This
	means performance is now somewhat degraded, because there is no
	buffering on I/O.

	* Allow wy60 to become a user's default shell. This can be used if
	a specific user always should run all programs within the
	emulator.

	* Updated the manual page.

	* Released version 1.0.1

2001-11-16  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* Added full command line parsing. Unknown parameters are still
	forwarded to the child process.

	* Introduced a distinction between launching a regular child
	process or an inferior shell. Only shells understand about leading
	'-' characters signaling a login shell.

	* Updated the documentation.

	* Released version 1.0

2001-11-11  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* Added support for dynamically changing the window size if
	supported by the host terminal emulation. This works for recent
	versions of xterm.

	* Added lots of predefined function key definitions. This works
	around the lack of proper terminfo entries for many host terminal
	emulators.

	* Completed code for parsing the configuration file.

	* Move cursors to closest corner if attempt is made to move it off
	the screen.

	* Check for all mandatory capabilities before emulation starts.

	* Added some more alternative algorithms to use if some of the
	capabilities are missing from the host terminal. Also, added code
	to prefer using parameterized commands if available.

	* Made sure that we only attempt to scroll if in top or bottom
	corner (this is suggested by the terminfo manual page).

	* Successfully tested wy60 running within a 3270 emulator.

	* Update internal cursor position when the screen gets cleared.

	* Added several conditional debugging modes for tracing program
	execution. This code is not usually compiled in.

	* Fixed attribute handling and switched to using colors if
	available.

	* Added support for graphics characters.

	* Output all of the terminal's reset or initialization strings
	both at program startup and termination.

2001-11-02  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* wy60 jumps to last character in previous line if backspace is
	issued in the first column. This fixes a display glitch in "vi".
	
	* Removed signal handling for SIGSTOP et. al, as these currently
	seem to be impossible to raise anyway.

	* Added code that parses escape sequences in the user input and
	maps function keys to the corresponding wy60 escape sequences.

	* Started work on parsing configuration files.

	* Added a "make install" target.
	
2001-10-29  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* Improved handling of terminal size changes.

2001-10-28  Markus Gutschke  <markus+wy60@wy60.gutschke.com>

	* Initial public release.

	* All of the core features are implemented. It is possible to run
	programs such emacs, vi, or less in the emulator. The emulator can
	also successfully emulate itself.

	* A lot of advanced features are still missing. Most notably this
	includes the status bar, programmable function keys, and text
	segments. It is not clear which of these features are actually
	used by real-life applications.
